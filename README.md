[which LLM provider you’re using today]

## Setup

To begin, you need to create a virtual environment and activate it.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To execute day 2 script, run the following commands:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m src.p1_chatbot.cli
```

To begin, you need to copy .env.example to .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY.
Ensure you do not commit .env by adding it to .gitignore.

## Running Day 1
To execute day 1 script, run the following commands:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m src.day_01.day_01_hello_world
```

## Troubleshooting
[include at least “missing API key” and “venv not activated”]
